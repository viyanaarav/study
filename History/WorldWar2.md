# World War 2



Japan even before the 1930's in 1910 had already occupied Korea and in 1931 it invades manchuria and japan installs a puppet state the state of manchukuo a puppet state is a state that pretends to be in charge but really in this case the empire of japan was in charge.
And meanwhile China is having a civil war between the Nationalists (KMT) and the Communists.
And because of the civil war in china japan is taking advantage of this to take over more parts of China until 1937 in 1937 Japan gives an excuse to have an all out war with China and this is often referred to as the Second Sino-Japanese War and some historians refer to this as the start of World War 2 but many people argue that this is only the Asian side beginning of World War 2 and World War 2 actually begins only after Germany invades Poland in 1939 that you have the formal beginning of World War 2.
In the 1930's in Europe Hitler's Germany Nazis are getting more and more millitaristic also allied with Mussolini's Italy they are both extremely nationalistic they hate communists.
In 1938 there is the Anschluss which was the unification with Austria and you also have germany take over the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia and the Allies are thinking that he is going to stop there because they dont want to start another war because they still remember WW2.
In 1939 March the Nazis take over all of Czechoslovakia and now the Allies are feeling uncomfortable they want to push back but they still don't want to start another war so they are hoping that maybe Germany stops there also in August of 1939 the Germans sign the Molotrov-Ribbentrop Pact with the Soviet Union.
On September 1st 1939 Germany invades Poland which is generally considered the beginning of World War 2 and then Great Britain and France declares war on Germany and at this point Stalin who is in control of the Soviet Union in this point of time is not too worried about Hitler he just signed the Molotrov-Ribbentrop pact so in mid September Stalin also invades Poland as well.
