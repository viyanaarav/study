# World War 2



Japan even before the 1930's in 1910 had already occupied Korea and in 1931 it invades manchuria and japan installs a puppet state the state of manchukuo a puppet state is a state that pretends to be in charge but really in this case the empire of japan was in charge.
And meanwhile China is having a civil war between the Nationalists (KMT) and the Communists.
And because of the civil war in china japan is taking advantage of this to take over more parts of China until 1937 in 1937 Japan gives an excuse to have an all out war with China and this is often referred to as the Second Sino-Japanese War and some historians refer to this as the start of World War 2 but many people argue that this is only the Asian side beginning of World War 2 and World War 2 actually begins only after Germany invades Poland in 1939 that you have the formal beginning of World War 2.
