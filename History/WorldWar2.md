# World War 2



Japan even before the 1930's in 1910 had already occupied Korea and in 1931 it invades manchuria and japan installs a puppet state the state of manchukuo a puppet state is a state that pretends to be in charge but really in this case the empire of japan was in charge.
And meanwhile China is having a civil war between the Nationalists (KMT) and the Communists.
And because of the civil war in china japan is taking advantage of this to take over more parts of China until 1937 in 1937 Japan gives an excuse to have an all out war with China and this is often referred to as the Second Sino-Japanese War and some historians refer to this as the start of World War 2 but many people argue that this is only the Asian side beginning of World War 2 and World War 2 actually begins only after Germany invades Poland in 1939 that you have the formal beginning of World War 2.
In the 1930's in Europe Hitler's Germany Nazis are getting more and more millitaristic also allied with Mussolini's Italy they are both extremely nationalistic they hate communists.
In 1938 there is the Anschluss which was the unification with Austria and you also have germany take over the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia and the Allies are thinking that he is going to stop there because they dont want to start another war because they still remember WW2.
In 1939 March the Nazis take over all of Czechoslovakia and now the Allies are feeling uncomfortable they want to push back but they still don't want to start another war so they are hoping that maybe Germany stops there also in August of 1939 the Germans sign the Molotrov-Ribbentrop Pact with the Soviet Union.
On September 1st 1939 Germany invades Poland which is generally considered the beginning of World War 2 and then Great Britain and France declares war on Germany and at this point Stalin who is in control of the Soviet Union in this point of time is not too worried about Hitler he just signed the Molotrov-Ribbentrop pact so in mid September Stalin also invades Poland as well.
In April 1940 Germany invades Denmark and Norway and then in May Germany invades the Netherlands and Belgium and then in June Italy declares war on the Allies (Great Britain and France) so now Italy is formally in WW2 and then France falls to the Germans so things are not looking good for the Allies and then in July Germany starts bombing Britain and then in September Japan joins the Axis Powers by signing the Tripartite Pact so now since Japan joins the Axis Powers and since Germany already took over France Japan wants to attack some of France's colonies and in particular French-Indochina so Japan attacks French Indo-China so now things are not looking good and it only gets worse from there and then in November Hungary and Romania are pressured into joining the Axis Powers so they join the Axis Powers so exiting 1940 things are not looking good for the Allies the only good thing happenning for the Allies is that the British are able to drive the Italians back into Libya and essentialy defeat the Italians in Libya.
In March of 1941 Bulgaria decides to join the Axis Powers and also in Libya the Italians get reinforcements Italian reinforcements and also German reinforcements under the command of Rommel the Desert Fox famous desert commander and they are able to push the British back to the Egpytian Border and take seige of the town of Tobruk.
Before WW2 started in early 1939 Italy actually took control of Albania and in late 1940's Italy uses Albania as a base of operation to invade Greece but they are pushed back and actually one of the reasons the British were pushed back in North Africa is because after they were succesful at pushing back the Italians they sent the bulk of the British forces to help defend Greece at the end of 1940 but then with the help of the Germans in 1941 the Axis Powers are able to take over Yugoslavia and Greece and start aerial bombardment of Crete.
Now we go into the Summer of 1941 and as you can imagine the Axis Powers in particular Hitler are feeling really confident because we are not even 2 years into the war and it looks like the Axis is going to win now you might remember they have the Molotrov-Ribbentrop pact with the Soviet Union but now Hitler's like i think im ready to attack and when you attack the Soviet Union really matters because you do not want to attack the Soviet Union/Russia in the Winter so in the Summer of 1941 Hitler figures this is the Axis's chance so in June he decides to attack the Soviet Union so by September the Germans are able to push all the way to Leningrad and then they start laying seige to that town and many historians will tell you that this was one of the great mistakes of Adolph Hitler because now he is stretched very thin and he has to fight 2 World Powers the Soviet Union and Great Britain and the United States hasn't entered into the war yet and thats what we are about to get into because in Asia in 1941 in July a little bit after Hitler decides to start invading the Soviet Union breaking the pact meanwhile the US were never okay with what was happening with Japan the Second Sino-Japanese War with China and also taking over French Indo-China so the US in July of 1941 decides to freeze the assets of Japan and probably the most important part of that was an oil embargo of Japan and so Japan really needs more natural resources so they on December 7/8 attack Malaya which was a British possesion and they also attack Pearl Harbor where the US's Pacific fleet is so they attack with hopes to knock out the US Pacific fleet so that the US will have trouble from stopping japan from doing whatever they want to do and they also attack Singapore and also Guam and Wake island and also the Philippines which was a US possession ever since the Spanish American war and also Hong Kong which was a British possession and also before the end of 1941 they attack Netherlands East Indies because it had a lot of resources and was also already overrun by the Germans and they also attack Burma so Japan was being very bold because of their imperial ambibions and the US were not happy about Japan's attack to Pearl Harbor and they were already sympathetic to the Allies because they didnt like what was going on in Europe they didnt like what was going on in China and that causes the United States to enter into World War 2 on the side of the Allies and then the Axis Powers decleared war on the US which was a big deal.
