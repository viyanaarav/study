# Indus Valley Essay

- Keeladi Civilization/Culture of 2600 years old
- Six carbon samples have been collected and sent to Beta Analytic Lab, Miami, Florida, USA for AMS [Accelerator Mass Spectrometry] from the excavations of keeladi dating and the reports have been received.
- The sample's collected at the deph of 353 cm goes back to 530 BCE. 
- The **Keeladi** cultural deposit could be safely date back to between 6th century BCE and 1st century CE.

The results suggest that the urbanization of vaigai plains happend in Tamil Nadu around 6th century BCE.

Also the results of the scientific dates obtained from the keeladi findings suggests that the Tamil-Brahmi goes back to another century i.e. 6th century BCE.
These results prove that they accessed or learned the art of writing in 6th century BCE.

70 skeletal fragments that have been collected from keeladi had been sent to Deccan College,Pune to analyze the faunal remains

The analysis was made to categorize thanks to the nature of the animals .
So from that the species such as Cow, Buffalo, Sheep, Goat and Ox were identified.

In all the species that were discovered the ox, cow, buffalo, and goat were probably used for agricultural purposes.
Meanwhile things like cut marks in the other animals like antelope, goat and wild boar show that they were consumed,
So the faunal remains show that the people mainly depended on agriculture and cattle rearing.

The samples like bricks, lime-motor and the roof tiles collected from the structural remains from keeladi were sent to the Vellore Institute of Technology for scientific material analysis.
The results from the analysis showed that all the specimen contained elements like silica, lime, ferrous, aluminum and magnesium
The more detailed report also furnishes of its constitution and nature.
The bricks and roof tiles contained more than 80% silica mixed with 7% of lime while lime plaster possessed 97% of lime.
 In fact the long of these materials with considerable strength and quality is thanks to the quality of the material deployed in the construction activities.

The well laid floor made of fine clay along with roof tiles in collapsed state.
Most probably wooden were planted over which roof was erected the occurrence of iron nails give clues of festering the poles and rafters.
The roof tiles contained finger groove impressions meant to drain water and double the holes at the top to be tied with rafters.
Such structural activities express the high standards of living during the sangam age.
