  Keeladi Civilization/Culture of 2600 years old
 Six carbon samples have been collected and sent to Beta Analytic Lab, Miami, Florida, USA for AMS [Accelerator Mass Spectrometry] from the excavations of keeladi dating and the reports have been received.
 The sample's collected at the deph of 353 cm goes back to 530 BCE. 
 The Keeladi cultural deposit could be safely date back to between 6th century BCE and 1st century CE.

The results suggest that the urbanization of vaigai plains happend in Tamil Nadu around 6th century BCE.

Also the results of the scientific dates obtained from the keeladi findings suggests that the Tamil-Brahmi goes back to another century i.e. 6th century BCE.
These results prove that they accessed or learned the art of writing in 6th century BCE.

70 skeletal fragments that have been collected from keeladi had been sent to Deccan College,Pune to analyze the faunal remains

The analysis was made to categorize thanks to the nature of the animals .
So from that the species such as Cow, Buffalo, Sheep, Goat and Ox were identified.

In all the species that were discovered the ox, cow, buffalo, and goat were probably used for agricultural purposes.
Meanwhile things like cut marks in the other animals like antelope, goat and wild boar show that they were consumed,
So the faunal remains show that the people mainly depended on agriculture and cattle rearing.

The samples like bricks, lime-motor and the roof tiles collected from the structural remains from keeladi were sent to the Vellore Institute of Technology for scientific material analysis.
The results from the analysis showed that all the specimen contained elements like silica, lime, ferrous, aluminum and magnesium
The more detailed report also furnishes of its constitution and nature.
The bricks and roof tiles contained more than 80% silica mixed with 7% of lime while lime plaster possessed 97% of lime.
 In fact the long of these materials with considerable strength and quality is thanks to the quality of the material deployed in the construction activities.

The well laid floor made of fine clay along with roof tiles in collapsed state.
Most probably wooden were planted over which roof was erected the occurrence of iron nails give clues of festering the poles and rafters.
The roof tiles contained finger groove impressions meant to drain water and double the holes at the top to be tied with rafters.
Such structural activities express the high standards of living during the sangam age.
17 pottery specimens in total were sent to the Earth Science Department of Pisa University, Italy through Vellore Institute of Technology for mineral analysis.
The samples were analyzed and the results confirmed that cooking vessels shaped from locally available materials.
 Also two quadrants of adjacent trenches below the depth of 4m revealed loads of potteries of many cart loads.
Also this amount of pottery shows that there could have been a pottery making industry at this place.
  
The Spectroscopic analysis of the Black and red ware sherds from Keeladi show that the black colour is due to use of carbon material and for the red is because of the use and presence of Hematite (Iron core). The potters of Keeladi were familiar with the technique and knew the art to produce the typical Black-and-Red ware pottery.

The results of the samples that were sent to the Pisa University, Italy reveal that the earthen vessels made by the people of Keeladi of Sangam Age followed the same technique and contents and constituents of clay from 6th century BCE to 2nd Century BCE. The same report also shows thatfew pottery samples of 2nd century BCE do contain earth content suggesting that they exchanged good between neighbouring regions through traders, craftsmen and visitors.

Many things such as seven gold ornaments, copper article, beads of gems, more than 4000 beads of semiprecious stones, glass beads,
shell bangles, ivory bangles and well crafted household utensils show the cultural richness and economic prosperity of the Sangam Age

The occurence of gamesmen like hop scotches and games affects the pastime activities of the ancient people.
Most of the gamesmen that were recovered from the excavations of keeladi are made of terracotta.
More than 600 hop scotches were discovered from the excavations even now the same game is there in madurai and other regions as 'Pandi'. 
Dices were also recovered from the site.
Apart from these 80 chessmen of similar shape but in different sizes were also collected from the excavation.

Terracotta objects were also recovered from the keeladi, excavation 13 are of human images, 3 of animals, more than 650 represent gamesmen and 35 are of ear ornaments. Other than that the site also had jewellery pieces of gold, copper, objects of iron were also recovered.
But it this site didn't have any objects that were meant for worship so far.
