# Hitler & the Nazis



After the WW1 ends in 1918 the republicans (the people who want to form a republic) take control and they sign an armistice with the Allies in November.
So many including hitler and in the military do not like this because they believe they that germany would have won WW1 if they were not stabbed in the back by the november criminals who had taken over after the Kaiser.
One of the 2 people Ludendorff that controled the germany the other one hindenburg believed that they would have won if they had not been stabbed in the back by the november criminals the people who had taken control of the government.
Then in 1919 for people like hitler things just got worse due to the Treaty of Versailles there were huge reparations that would even be paid in resources also some of the land of the german empire was given away to the allies.
Hitler stayed in the military being sad about the war ending and being in the military he was given a job to spy on the German Worker's Party (DAP) which was all about german race superiority and anti-communist and anti-capitalist also anti- jewish it was also in line with the whole Stab in the back theory so hitler liked this.
So Hitler actually joins them as their 55th member so at this point it is a very very small party.
By 1920 the leaders of the party took a note of hitler and later they conclude that hitler is actually a very good orator.
So they give him more and more talks then he gets more and more authority and then for the party to have more appeal they change their name to German Worker's Party they add Nationalist Socialist DAP (NSDAP).
And if you pronounce nationalist in german it sounds something like Nazionalist so they shortend it to the Nazis.
By 1921 there were some disagreements in the party and Hitler was like hey if there is an argument im gonna leave the party and the party knew he had so much value to the party and the party would just crumble if he leaves so they make him the chairman.
