## Animal Classification

When studying biology you will need a basic understanding of the classification system that is used to group all of the animals.
Classification is the way that we sort different species into different groups depending on how closely related they are in evolution, behaviour and structure and the science of classification is known as taxonomy.
If organisms have basic similar features they are put together into a kingdom for example if an organism obtains its food by ingestion and is multicellular it is placed in the animal kingdom the other kingdoms are plants and fungi.
The animal kingdom is still has more subdivisions based upon similarities of organisms into a hierarchical system this narrows down the classification until we reach a particular genus and species.
Most living organisms are identified by a genus and species known as the binomial system.
All the species in the animal kingdom are divided into those which have backbones the vertibrates and the ones that dont the invertibrates the vertibrates are split into eight classes the most important of the eight are:

- Amphibia - approximately 3080 species
- Reptilia - approximately 6600 species
- Aves/Birds - approximately 8500 species
- Fish - approximately 30,000 species
- Mammalia - approximately 4070 species

Then these classes are further divided into orders and more until a species is identified.
The disctinctive features of mammals are the production of milk from the mammary glands and the possesion of hair as a body covering some examples of mammalian orders are:

Insectivores (e.g., shrews, moles)
- Rodents (e.g., mice, rats)
- Lagomorphs (e.g., rabbits, hares)
- Carnivores (e.g., cats, dogs, bears, seals)
- Ungulates (e.g., cows, sheep, horses)
- Cetaceans (e.g., whales, dolphins)
- Primates (e.g., monkeys, apes)

Species                           familiaris            catus

Common name                       Domestic dog          Domestic cat

Generally all mammals have a similar basic structural play in terms of anatomy and physiology but mammals have become specialised for activites such as running, digging, jumping, gnawing and eating specific foods.
