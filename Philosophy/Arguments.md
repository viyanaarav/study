# ARGUMENTS

DEDUCTIVE ARGUMENTS

so in philosophy there are different kind of arguments the first one is a deductive argument 
and in a deductive argument the main rule is that if your premises are true your conclusion MUST be true.
here is an example :

EXAMPLE 1

Premise 1: All humans are mortal.
Premise 2: Socrates is a human.
Conclusion: Socrates is mortal
 

Example 1 is a valid argument because both of the premises are true so the conclusion must be true.
And when one fact leads to the other it is called entailment.

Here is another example:

EXAMPLE 2

Premise 1: All humans are mortal.
Premise 2: Socrates is a human.
Conclusion: Socrates was Plato's Teacher


Example 2 is a invalid argument because  
the first premise states that all humans are mortal and
the second premise states that socrates is a human.
however the conclusion states that socrates was plato's teacher
which has nothing to do with premise one and two.
VALIDITY IS NOT TRUTH.
all validity means is that IF THE PREMISES ARE TRUE, THEN THE CONCLUSION CAN'T BE FALSE.
But that dosen't mean that premises prove your conclusion to be correct.


Here is another example:

EXAMPLE 3

Premise 1: All humans have tails
Premise 2: John is a human
Conclusion: John has a tail

Example 3 is a valid argument because the premises entail the conclusion.
It's just that one of the premises are flawed.




INDUCTIVE ARGUMENTS

Induction is using your past experience to make future predictions.

Like for example you believe you should take a aspirin tablet to cure your headache 
because it has cured countless headaches in the past.
Likewise you want to watch to new marvel movie cause you liked most of the previous one's
so you believe they will continue to deliver for you entertainment wise.
But its important to also remember that unlike deduction where true premises entail true conclusions
inductive premises only mean that the conclusion is likely to be true.
Inductive arguments do not provide you with certainty.
Instead, they work in terms of probability.
Here is an example:

Example 1

Premise 1: Most men in ancient athens had beards.
Premise 2: Socrates was a man who lived in ancient athens.
Conclusion: Therefore, socrates probably had a beard.
