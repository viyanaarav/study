# BINARY SYSTEM

So the binary system has only 2 numbers 0,1 because the computer can only process 2 things off and on  0 is off and 1 is on here is an example:

1001011

You have to go from right to left
the rightmost digit 1 is multiplied by one, sum = 1
then the digit to the left,1 multiplied by two, sum = 3
the digit after that is 0 multiplied by 4, sum = 3
the digit after that  is 1 multiplied by 8, sum = 11
next two digits are 0 x 16, 0 x 32, sum is still 11
then the leftmost digit is 1 multiplied by 64

Final Sum Is : 75
